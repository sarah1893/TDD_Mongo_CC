# Intro To Databases
Mongoose is a Node package that interacts with a running MongoDB database. Before learning about Mongoose, let’s define a couple of key terms:
- Data
- Database

## What is Data?
Data in the context of software and web development is digital information.

## What is a Database?
A database is a structured set of data held in a computer.

Databases support storage and manipulation of data. For a web application to have persistence, a developer uses a database to store data. The developer can write methods to create, read, update, and delete information in the database.

# Mongoose Collections & Documents
Mongo stores data in ‘binary’ JSON (BSON) documents. BSON documents have a similar structure to JavaScript objects.

MongoDB stores documents in a collection. A MongoDB database is made up of these collections of documents.

A Mongo collection is like a table in a spreadsheet or relational database — each document is like a row in the spreadsheet.

Documents contain one or more key/value pairs. Each key has a corresponding value of a specified data type, like array, number, or string. MongoDB organizes documents with similar structure into collections.
